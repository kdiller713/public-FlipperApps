# VL6180X Pong

This is a copy of the [Flipper Zero Pong](https://github.com/xMasterX/all-the-plugins/tree/dev/apps_source_code/flipper_pong) game, but uses a VL6180x module to control the paddle instead of the buttons.

See the [VL6180X README](../vl6180x/README.md) for more details on setting the Flipper up with the VL6180X.
